# springboot-aws-localstack-opensearch-s3-secretsmanager

In this project, we are going to use [`LocalStack`](https://localstack.cloud/) to simulate locally, some services provided by [`AWS Cloud`](https://aws.amazon.com/) such as [`OpenSearch`](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/), [`S3`](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), and [`Secrets Manager`](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/). Also, in order to simplify the use of AWS managed services, we are going to use [`Spring Cloud AWS`](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-aws).

> **Note**: Check out the [`springboot-aws-localstack-dynamodb-lambda-sns-sqs`](https://github.com/ivangfr/springboot-aws-localstack-dynamodb-lambda-sns-sqs) repository. In it, we've developed two Spring Boot applications for producing and listening to news updates. We also utilized LocalStack to locally simulate AWS Cloud services like [`DynamoDB`](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), [`Lambda`](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [`SNS`](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) and [`SQS`](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/).

## Proof-of-Concepts & Articles

On [ivangfr.github.io](https://ivangfr.github.io), I have compiled my Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs) and articles. You can easily search for the technology you are interested in by using the filter. Who knows, perhaps I have already implemented a PoC or written an article about what you are looking for.

## Applications

- ### movie-api

  [`Spring Boot`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/) Java Web application that exposes a REST API and provides a UI for indexing movies.

  It has the following endpoints:
  ```
   GET /api/movies/{imdb}
  POST /api/movies {"imdb":"...", "title":"...", "posterUrl":"...", "year":"...", "released":"...", "imdbRating":"...", "genre":"...", "runtime":"...", "director":"...", "writer":"...", "actors":"...", "plot":"...", "language":"...", "country":"...", "awards":"..."}
  POST /api/movies/{imdb}/uploadPoster
  ```

  The information of the movies, such as `imdb`, `title`, `year`, etc, are stored in `OpenSearch` that is hosted in `LocalStack`. The movie's `poster` are stored in `S3` buckets.

  The `movie-api` has access to [`OMDb API`](https://www.omdbapi.com/) to search and add easily new movies. In order to make request to `OMDb API`, an `apiKey` is needed. This key is stored as a secret in `Secrets Manager`.

- ### movie-ui

  `Spring Boot` Java Web application with a user interface designed for searching movies indexed in `movie-api`. To populate its UI with movie data, `movie-ui` communicates with `movie-api` by making requests to its endpoints. The movieâ€™s poster is retrieved from the `S3` bucket.

## Prerequisites

- [`Java 17+`](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17)
- [`Docker`](https://www.docker.com/)
- [`OMDb API`](https://www.omdbapi.com/) KEY

  To search movies in `OMDb API`, we need to obtain an API KEY from `OMDb API`. In order to do it, access https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx and follow the steps provided by the website.

## Start and Initialize LocalStack

- In a terminal, make sure you are in inside `springboot-aws-localstack-opensearch-s3-secretsmanager` root folder

- Start `LocalStack` Docker container
  ```
  DEBUG=1 docker compose up -d
  ```

- \[Optional\] Debug logs are enabled so that we have more insights about what is happening. To monitor `localstack` Docker container logs, run the command below
  ```
  docker logs localstack -f
  ```

- Initialize `LocalStack` by running the following script
  ```
  ./init-localstack.sh <OMDB_API_KEY>
  ```
  The script requires `OMDB_API_KEY` as first and unique argument. The script will create:
  - a domain for `OpenSearch` as well as the `movies` index using the `movies-settings.json` provided;
  - bucket `com.ivanfranchin.movieapi.posters` in `S3`;
  - a secret for `OMDB_API_KEY` in `Secrets Manager`.

## Running applications with Maven

- **movie-api**
  
  In a terminal and, inside `springboot-aws-localstack-opensearch-s3-secretsmanager` root folder, run the following command
  ```
  export AWS_REGION=eu-west-1 && export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=key && export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=secret && \
    ./mvnw clean spring-boot:run --projects movie-api
  ```

- **movie-ui**

  In another terminal and, inside `springboot-aws-localstack-opensearch-s3-secretsmanager` root folder, run the command below
